# Martyr Data Management System

## Description
In this project, the goal is to implement a data structure for managing martyr records using sorted doubly circular linked lists, AVL trees, queues, and stacks. The project requires the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX to provide a user-friendly experience. The data input for the project is a CSV file containing martyr records (btselem.csv). The GUI allows the user to load the martyrs file, fill the data structures, and choose from a list of functions. These functions include inserting and updating location records, searching for location records and loading associated martyr records, inserting and updating martyr records, searching for martyrs by name, and generating summary reports for selected locations. The summary reports include information such as the number of martyrs in a location, the height of AVL trees, and the date with the maximum number of martyrs.


## Features

- Load martyrs' records from a CSV file: The program allows the user to load a CSV file containing martyr records. This data is then used to populate the data structures.

- Insert, update, and delete location records: The program provides options to insert new location records, update existing ones, and delete location records if needed.

- Search for location records and load associated martyr records: The user can search for a specific location record and retrieve the associated martyr records for that location.

- Insert, update, and delete martyr records: The program allows the user to insert new martyr records, update existing ones, and delete martyr records as required.

- Search for martyrs by part of name: The user can search for martyrs by entering a part of their name. The program will retrieve all matching martyr records.

- Generate summary reports for selected locations: The program can generate summary reports for selected locations. These reports include the number of martyrs in the selected location, the height of the AVL trees, and the date with the maximum number of martyrs.

- Traverse AVL trees and print martyr information: The program can traverse the AVL trees and print the full information of the martyrs stored in them. This allows for easy access to the martyr records.

- Save updated data structures back to a file: The program provides a "Save Screen" where the user can save the updated data structures back to a file in the same format as the input CSV file.
