# Martyr Data Management System

## Description
In this project, the goal is to implement a data structure for managing martyr records using sorted doubly circular linked lists, AVL trees, queues, and stacks. The project requires the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX to provide a user-friendly experience. The data input for the project is a CSV file containing martyr records (btselem.csv). The GUI allows the user to load the martyrs file, fill the data structures, and choose from a list of functions. These functions include inserting and updating location records, searching for location records and loading associated martyr records, inserting and updating martyr records, searching for martyrs by name, and generating summary reports for selected locations. The summary reports include information such as the number of martyrs in a location, the height of AVL trees, and the date with the maximum number of martyrs.


## Features

- Load martyrs csv file
- Create a sorted single linked list to hold martyr object information
- Create a sorted doubly linked list that contains the location and a single list of martyr objects
- Insert new location records
- Update or delete location records
- Search for location records and load associated martyr records
- Update or delete martyr records
- Search for martyr records by name
- Generate summary reports for selected locations, including the number of martyrs by age and gender, average age of martyrs, and date with the maximum number of martyrs
- Navigate through locations using next and previous buttons
- Save updated linked lists back to a file in the same format as the input file
